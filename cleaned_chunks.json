If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency, and vibration as quoted by ' Nicola Tesla', was proven right by the teachers of KSSEM. Firstly I would like to thank the editorial team for giving me this opportunity. When I first stepped into KSSEM College I never expected my life to take such a wonderful phase! Initially, when I was in my first year, I thought my engineering life would be study oriented, but as I entered the COMPUTER SCIENCE branch it all changed!! Teachers were so experienced and knowledgeable that they not only helped me to excel in academics but in building my character. They were very much supportive in all ways. Apart from classroom studies, KSSEM highly encourages students to take up extracurricular activities; the most memorable will be the college fest AAROHANA 2022. I am grateful to have had such an opportunity; this helped me immensely gain knowledge and also made me a betterment engineer. I would like to thank every member of our department and Management for their support and encouragement. Hello, I am Amitha S M a passed out of 2022 batch from KSSEM and currently placed in Giant Eagle and NTT Data Services. Firstly the infrastructure of the college is really good and located in a peaceful environment. The college provides the laboratories with the required open source software and internet facilities. The faculties of the college are very supportive and encourage students to develop their skills. The college also has a basketball court, Xerox Shop and Canteen. Along with this there are annual sports and cultural activities to promote good culture among the students. The placement cell of the college helps every student to get placed, this starts from 1st year of the course itself by providing technical and soft skill training. The college also promotes anti-ragging and tobacco free in the premises. The college has helped me to develop my skills and work in any given environment. Going into college, my only goal was to graduate with an engineering degree. But, looking back on the last four years, KSSEM has played an integral part in my development as a capable software engineer. The university has constantly provided me with good opportunities and resources to improve myself. The faculty at Computer Science Engineering is second to none. They are proficient, accessible, and patient. My bachelor's degree at KSSEM majoring in Software Technology has been eye-opening. The placement team here works hard to bring in several core and big companies; there are placement drives happening almost every day. The workshops and hackathons conducted by the various teams here at the institution helped me get a good overview of what is needed to work in a collaborative and professional environment. I am very grateful to them for assisting me in obtaining an internship at Celstream Technologies as an Interim Engineering Intern.
