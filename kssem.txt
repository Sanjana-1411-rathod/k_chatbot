Most humbly, my name is Kruthika B and I am a passed-out student of the 2022 batch of Computer Science and Engineering branch of K S School of Engineering and Management. I am glad to provide you with my feedback about the college. My overall experience to date has been amazing, and the college is having an amazing infrastructure and environment. The college provides excellent placement opportunities. I have been placed in 9 companies through the placement drives conducted by our college (Expleo, Valenta, Infosys, Giant Eagle, 6D Technologies, Capgemini). I have been also placed at Daimler (DTICI) with a package of 10LPA. Our college has provided me with a number of opportunities to grow and explore my skills. The emphasis on sports along with education always helped me a lot. I have always found a positive and healthy environment and the teachers are highly supportive and friendly. Most of my doubts were cleared after the classes were over. I am highly thankful to you for providing me with an opportunity to be a part of our college. It has added a number of values to my life.
My experience in college has been one of the richest experiences of my professional life. This college has given me hope about what higher education can do, it encourages individuality and conductivity. Kssem has one of the best labs, facilities, library, campus, faculty, staffs and canteen. The college library has variety of books on different domains and is easy to access with the help of staff who are more than ready to help. The faculty are very welcoming and friendly going with students. The last fest Aarohana was from 20th to 24th of june 2022 which is the best experience I had in this college. Personally to me memories of Aarohana is the best of all where I enjoyed the most after academics. I would say experiences i had in kssem is one of the best and will always be memorable.

Finding the right path to success at the right time is very important and for that way, I selected K S School of Engineering And Management. At the very outset, I would like to express my heartiest thanks to the department of E.C.E, K.S.S.E.M. In K.S.S.E.M we are trained for our placements and because of that, I was placed in one of the reputed companies. The friendly environment and the systematic approach towards imparting education at K.S.S.E.M made me a competent individual. Today, if I am in a good position it?s majorly because of what I have learned from K.S.S.E.M. The wide range of activities both curricular and co-curricular and the support from each faculty member of the E.C.E department of K.S.S.E.M was very helpful for my personal and professional growth. The faculties are very kind and approachable when any need arises. The E.C.E department professors and excellent lab facilities helped me to develop my personal and professional skills and helped me achieve great heights during my stay at K.S.S.E.M. During academic activities, the E.C.E department and especially my favorite Renuka ma'am helped me to get a lot of in-depth knowledge and understanding of cutting-edge technologies and their use in various industrial areas. It was a great experience to study here and make ourselves what we are today. I am proud to be a part of the KSSEM family.
My name is Sadhana H C having USN 1KG18EC046. I'm a student of Electronics and Communication Engineering from 2018 to 2022. My experience in this college has been amazing overall, as I entered into my first year of academics all the professors were very generous in helping me understand the concepts better and made sure to clear my doubts within the class itself. Our college has great infrastructure, labs, auditoriums, and a canteen and there is also a basketball court. Everything is very hygienic and well maintained. There is IEEE Student Branch, NSS, and Rotary Club in the college which keeps all the students involved in co-curricular activities as well. I served our IEEE Student Branch as Chairperson for a year, where we conducted a lot of events which are technical and non-technical many more every month. It helped me imbibe qualities such as leadership, voluntariness, team player, communication skills and many more. There is also special placement training that is organised by the Placement department of the college for all the students. They helped us comprehend from the very basics of aptitude to how to face the interview and soft skills with various tips and tricks. I have been placed at TATA Consultancy Services as Assistant System Engineer in Web development and Project Management with CTC of 3.36 LPA. I'm grateful to my college for always encouraging, supportive and motivating us in each step to aim high and accomplish our goals. Thank you

I am fortunate to spend these wonderful two years of M. Tech at KS School of Engineering Management; it was a memorable journey of learning technical as well as life lessons. The establishment provides a welcoming atmosphere in which students feel free to communicate with professionals. Faculty members of civil department were supportive, best part is they teach concepts from basic even though we are M. Tech students, especially during pandemic online classes their efforts were a huge support. We always get a positive response when we need help regarding internship and placements; there is great exposure to research as well as extracurricular activities for M. Tech students which I love the most. I am thankful to KSSEM and Civil department for quality education and great opportunities.

If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency, and vibration as quoted by ' Nicola Tesla', was proven right by the teachers of KSSEM. Firstly I would like to thank the editorial team for giving me this opportunity. When I first stepped into KSSEM College I never expected my life to take such a wonderful phase! Initially, when I was in my first year, I thought my engineering life would be study oriented, but as I entered the COMPUTER SCIENCE branch it all changed!! Teachers were so experienced and knowledgeable that they not only helped me to excel in academics but in building my character. They were very much supportive in all ways. Apart from classroom studies, KSSEM highly encourages students to take up extracurricular activities; the most memorable will be the college fest AAROHANA 2022. I am grateful to have had such an opportunity; this helped me immensely gain knowledge and also made me a betterment engineer. I would like to thank every member of our department and Management for their support and encouragement.

Going into college, my only goal was to graduate with an engineering degree. But, looking back on the last four years, KSSEM has played an integral part in my development as a capable software engineer. The university has constantly provided me with good opportunities and resources to improve myself. The faculty at Computer Science Engineering is second to none. They are proficient, accessible, and patient. My bachelor's degree at KSSEM majoring in Software Technology has been eye-opening. The placement team here works hard to bring in several core and big companies; there are placement drives happening almost every day. The workshops and hackathons conducted by the various teams here at the institution helped me get a good overview of what is needed to work in a collaborative and professional environment. I am very grateful to them for assisting me in obtaining an internship at Celstream Technologies as an Interim Engineering Intern.
